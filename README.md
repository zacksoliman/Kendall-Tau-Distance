Important:

    Anyone reading the code for this project will notice that it isn't well
    commented and the code is hard to read/understand.

    This is due to the fact that  I'm using this code to explore ideas I get
    during my research; as I get ideas I write functions to help me compute
    some thing interesting and check out if there is anything worth investigating 
    further. I write these functions quickly and without concern for readability 
    and I am sorry for that to anyone trying to reade the code.

    So beware of the messy code if your interested in reading it.
